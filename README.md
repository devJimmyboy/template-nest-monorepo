# Turborepo starter

This is an official Yarn v1 starter turborepo.

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `api`: a [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com) app
- `web`: a [Vite.js React](https://vitejs.dev) app
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

## Setup

This repository is used in the `npx create-turbo` command, and selected when choosing which package manager you wish to use with your monorepo (Yarn).

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd "*$(pwd)*"
yarn run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd "*$(pwd)*"
